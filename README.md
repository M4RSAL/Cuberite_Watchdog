# Cuberite_Watchdog
My Cubrite server crashes from time to time, so i made a keep-alive batch file...

Stoping the server:
Close the MCServer.exe/Cuberite.exe Window and type Y in the command window to stop the server

# Innstalation:
1. Copy and drag Cuberite_Watchdog.bat to your Cuberite server directory
2. Start the Cuberite_Watchdog.bat
3. DONE!
